## Overview of the school district analysis

Maria has asked us for help to analyze data on Student funding  and students standarized test scores. We will be given acess to every student's math and reading scores as well as various information of schools they attend. Our task is to aggregate that data and showcase trends in school performance. this analysis will help School Board in making descisions regardiong school Budget and priorities.


## Challenge Overview
After we provided an analysis as per Maria's requirements PyCitySchools.ipynb. The School Board had notified Maria and her Supervisor that the file shows evidence of academic dishonesty; specifically, reading and math grades for Thomas High School ninth graders appears to have been altered. 
Although the school board does not know the full extent of the academic dishonesty, they want to uphold state-testing standards and have turned to Maria for help. 
She has asked us to replace the math and reading scores for Thomas High School with NaNs while keeping the rest of the data intact. Once youâ€™ve replaced the math and reading scores, Maria would like you to repeat the school district analysis that you did in this module and write up a report to describe how these changes affected the overall analysis.
